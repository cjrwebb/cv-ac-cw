# cv-ac-cw
CV based on custom awesome-cv from `vitae` package; uses `scholar` and `rorcid` packages to fetch relevant employment, citation, and eductaion data and draws other common academic CV data from some .csv files. Some flourishes with ggplot graphs and a panelled image showing apps developed. Can be customised by replacing orcid and scholar id, but plots may be unstable.
